# ðŸ“Š Chronic Health Conditions Analysis & Prediction

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
Chronic diseases such as **diabetes, cardiovascular conditions, and mental health disorders** pose significant public health and economic challenges. Healthcare providers, insurers, and policymakers need **data-driven strategies** to allocate resources, design intervention programs, and reduce long-term costs. 

This project builds a **decision-support framework** to identify **high-risk populations**, segment communities based on health risks, and predict disease prevalence. By integrating **predictive modeling, clustering, and geospatial analysis**, this project enables stakeholders to shift from **reactive healthcare spending to proactive risk mitigation**.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives & Approach
This analysis delivers insights that drive healthcare strategy and resource allocation:

- **Predicting Chronic Disease Prevalence** â†’ Machine learning models to forecast **high-risk populations**.
- **Segmentation & Risk Profiling** â†’ Clustering techniques to categorize **population health risks**.
- **Regional Health Disparity Analysis** â†’ Interactive **Tableau dashboards** to highlight **geographic gaps in healthcare**.
- **Benchmarking & Trend Comparisons** â†’ Evaluating regional prevalence **against national standards**.

## ðŸ“ˆ Key Insights & Findings

### **Predictive Modeling & Risk Identification**
- **Certain states exhibit prevalence rates exceeding national benchmarks by over 76.6%**, requiring targeted interventions.
- **Key risk factors include BMI, hypertension, smoking, and limited healthcare access**.
- **Random Forest model achieved 82% accuracy**, with **age, BMI, and healthcare access** as primary predictors.

### **Population Segmentation & Health Profiling**
- **Four major health risk clusters emerged**:
  - **Cluster 1 (42.09%)** â†’ High-risk individuals with multiple chronic conditions.
  - **Cluster 2 & 3** â†’ Mid-risk groups with mixed socioeconomic determinants.
  - **Cluster 4** â†’ Low-risk populations benefiting from access to healthcare.
- **Cluster-based insights** support targeted policy design for public health agencies.

### **Geospatial Trends & Healthcare Accessibility Gaps**
- **Heatmaps reveal underutilization of preventive healthcare in certain regions**.
- **Regional deviation analysis highlights conditions with unexpected prevalence spikes**.
- **Population density vs. condition prevalence analysis** indicates **rural vs. urban disparities in healthcare access**.
